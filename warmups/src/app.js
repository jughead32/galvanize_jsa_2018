// *****************************************
// Functions Warmup

// Create a function called "addFive" that takes one parameter that you will assume will be a number. The returned value will be the argument plus 5. For example, if 2 was passed in, the returned value would be 7.


// *****************************************
// Arrays Warmup

// Create a function called "addAnArray" that takes two arrays as parameters that will add one array to another. For example, if [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] were passed in, the result should be [1,2,3,4,5,6]


// *****************************************
// Loops Warmup

// Create a function called "addOne" that will increment the value every index in the array by one. For example, if [1,2,3] was passed in, the result should be [2,3,4]


// *****************************************
// Conditionals Warmup

// Create a function called "evensAndOdds" that will take an array of numbers as a parameter. That array will return an array of two arrays, the first array being the array of even numbers and the second array being the array of the odd numbers. For example, if [1,2,3,4] was passed in as an argument, the returned value would be [[2,4],[1,3]].


// *****************************************
// Objects Warmup

// Create a function called "addAPerson" that takes three parameters and adds a person object to an array of people. The first parameter is the array being added to, the second is the name of the person (a string), and the third is the age (a number).

var people = [{
  name: 'dave',
  age: 44
}];
