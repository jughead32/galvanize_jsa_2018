### Assignments
Assignments will be provided inside of the main Github repository for this class.

### Class Structure
The first hour of the class will consist of review of the material from the previous class and the presentation of the material for the current class. The second hour will give you time to work on the assignments for the current class. The third hour will be used to create a project that will be built upon each class, the end result being a fully functional todo app that will be on your Github profile.

### Schedule
Note: This schedule is approximate, and may change based on the needs of the class or other circumstances. Make sure that you fork the assignment repositories on Github so you can push your changes to them! If you don't know what that means, worry not, we will tell you before you start them.

* Class 1: Expectations setting, learn to learn, set up machines, intro to html/css
  * Today's objective:  Students will be able to articulate and explain 3 main things that Javascript can be used for ( data processing, API calls, and DOM manipulation )
  * Software setup:
    * Atom
    * Github (set up keys to push and pull or use Github desktop)
    * Questions and assignment submissions should be directed to troy.amelotte@galvanize.com GALVANIZE address for all general email !!
    * Notes

* Class 2: Data Types and Variables
  * Objectives:
    * Describe the 5 different primitive data types in JS.
    * Use PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication etc) to evaluate expressions.
    * Use variables to store and re-store any and all primitive data types.
    * Manipulate and target strings using js methods and targeting syntaxes.
    * Use booleans and numbers to evaluate logical operators.
    * Combine logical operators to evaluate complex logical scenarios.
    * Describe type coercion and explain the difference between the == and the === operator.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Click here](/exercises/variables-data-types)
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * Build a single web page that could eventually serve as your personal site. Include a photo, short bio, links to your other online profiles, and a link where someone can email you directly from the page. Style it however you would like.

* Class 3: Functions
  * Objectives:
    * Describe the anatomy of a function definition.
    * Articulate the difference between defining and invoking a function.
    * Create functions with named parameters, and pass in arguments when calling them.
    * Use functions to create meaningful names for reused, abstract code blocks.
    * Identify the difference between console.log() and return inside functions.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Functions](/exercises/functions)
  * Concept Practice:
    * Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) and create functions that satisfy the following
    requirements:
      * Subtracting one number from another
      * Dividing one number by another
      * Adding three numbers together
      * Find the slope of a line
    * When finished, continue working on your personal web page

* Class 4: Arrays
  * Warmup
  * Objectives:
    * Create an array and access array elements using JS.
    * Add, modify, and remove elements in an array.
    * Name and describe the 4 methods used to add and remove elements from the front and back of an array.
    * Use the concat method to join 2 or more arrays.
    * Join arrays into strings and split strings into arrays.
    * Use Math.floor() and Math.random() to generate random integers.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Arrays](/exercises/arrays)
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * When finished with arrays exercises, continue working on one of the following:
      * Personal web page
      * Data Types and Variables concept practice
      * Functions concept practice

* Class 5: Loops
  * Warmup
  * Objectives:
    * Explain how while loops work.
    * Build a while loop.
    * Describe how to avoid building an infinite loop.
    * Explain how for loops work, and explain what the setup, condition, and increment are.
    * Be able to answer why someone would choose to build a while or for loop.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Loops](/exercises/loops)
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * When finished with loops concept practice, begin thinking about what's required
    to build a To Do List webpage with JavaScript.
      * Using variables, functions, arrays, and loops, how can you add a to do list
      item to a collection of to do list items? How would you present the collection
      of all to do list items? How could you mark items complete and remove them
      from the to do list? Begin by breaking this problem down into individual steps
      that require a single action (function, loop, variable assignment, etc)
      using javascript.
      * To help you get started...
         * Write a function that takes a string and adds a To Do item to a list of
         To Dos
         * Write a function that presents a list of To Dos to the console
         * Write a function that removes a To Do from the end of the list
         * Write a function that removes a To Do from any position inside of the list
         * Assume a list of To Dos is represented by a string in the following 2 formats:
           * "Mow lawn - complete"
           * "Wash dishes - incomplete"
           * Sort the complete To Dos into one list and the incomplete To Dos into another list
         * Stretch goal: refactor the To Do item using an array of objects instead of an array of strings. The To Do item should contain two properties: text and "completedness"

* Class 6: Conditional Statements (If/Else)
  * Warmup
  * Objectives:
    * Articulate the difference between a conditional and a loop.
    * Explain how if statements work.
    * Chain an if statement using else if and end with an else statement.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Conditionals](/exercises/conditionals)
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * Continue the To Do List webpage project

* Class 7: Objects
  * Objectives:
    * Describe the differences between objects and arrays.
    * Create objects using the object literal syntax.
    * Access and add values in an object using both bracket and dot notation. Describe the difference between them.
    * Combine objects and arrays to create arrays of objects and objects with array values.
    * Combine targeting methods to target specific values in objects which are in an array.
  * Concept Practice:
    * [Objects](/exercises/objects)
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * Continue working on To Do List project or take home exam

* Class 8: Review
  * Warmup
  * Class Project Assignment:
    * Continue working on To Do List project, lodash, or take home exam

Galvanize approaches learning using Standards Based Education. These are the discrete skills that you are tackling and will be assessed on:

* Approaches learning in a methodical and disciplined manner
* Approaches web development with a growth mindset and ability for self-reflection
* Write and evaluate JS expressions
* Organize code with JS functions
